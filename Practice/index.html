            Hi I am Sydney Wathuta the chief developer, designer, and founder of Studio Runa.</p><br>
            <p>As a developer and lifelong fan of the beautiful game, I started Studio Runa to help teams, 
            clubs, and soccer creators build digital homes that are as passionate and professional as 
            they are. I created Studio Runa to build digital spaces that feel just as intentional as the 
            brands behind them. With a minimalist eye and a hands-on process, I help small teams 
            and solo founders turn ideas into beautifully functional websites.</p>
